#~ "reflection as well as action needs "

#~ "degree. The responsibility has then "
#~ "fallen to the shoulder of us, the"

#~ "Inspired by the rapid development of "
#~ "Internet, Orange Academy has initiated "
#~ "an experimental form of education—online "
#~ "curriculum system plus real-time "
#~ "discussion program—in an effort to "
#~ "better the expression and thinking "
#~ "ability of those students coming from"
#~ " less-developed areas. As our "
#~ "volunteer members, coming from Beijing, "
#~ "Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guiyang, the US, and"
#~ " Australia, soar to 102 and beyond,"
#~ " we incorporate more than 400 "
#~ "students from WuXiang, XingGuo, and "
#~ "YiChun, covering three different provinces "
#~ "in China. On the other hand, our"
#~ " teaching contents are also refining "
#~ "along the way. Back in the fall"
#~ " of 2017, aiming at fostering "
#~ "academic interest, critical thinking, "
#~ "expression ability, and confidence build-"
#~ "up, we self-designed numerous courses"
#~ " in accordance with the circumstance "
#~ "of our targeted students. Facilitated by"
#~ " video platforms and WeChat group, "
#~ "our volunteers uploaded more than 700"
#~ " minutes tutoring videos, organized more"
#~ " than 80 times interactive discussions, "
#~ "produced more than fifty-thousand Q&A,"
#~ " and drew down more than ninety-"
#~ "thousand original words in the process"
#~ " of lecture preparation. In addition, "
#~ "we investigated other high-school "
#~ "students&apos; awareness towards the issue "
#~ "of education, the result was disturbing:"
#~ " most of them submit to the "
#~ "current education situation and even "
#~ "take it for granted, while only "
#~ "care about their own benefits and "
#~ "future success. To tackle down this "
#~ "dilemma, our team strives to spread "
#~ "the awareness by updating public "
#~ "account, advertising our video, open "
#~ "education-related electives at school. "
#~ "Hopefully other teenagers will join us"
#~ " and we can lay the foundation "
#~ "for future \"reformers\".\n"
