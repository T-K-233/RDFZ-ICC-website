"The Elementary Education plays a significant role upon the society, both "
"socially and economically. However, with its \"inequality\" status quo "
"drawing more attention from the public, reflection as well as action "
"needs to be addressed in an imperative degree. The responsibility has "
"then fallen to the shoulder of us, the teenagers.\n"
"Inspired by the rapid development of Internet, Orange Academy has "
"initiated an experimental form of education—online curriculum system plus"
" real-time discussion program—in an effort to better the expression and "
"thinking ability of those students coming from less-developed areas. As "
"our volunteer members, coming from Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guiyang, "
"the US, and Australia, soar to 102 and beyond, we incorporate more than "
"400 students from WuXiang, XingGuo, and YiChun, covering three different "
"provinces in China. On the other hand, our teaching contents are also "
"refining along the way. Back in the fall of 2017, aiming at fostering "
"academic interest, critical thinking, expression ability, and confidence "
"build-up, we self-designed numerous courses in accordance with the "
"circumstance of our targeted students. Facilitated by video platforms and"
" WeChat group, our volunteers uploaded more than 700 minutes tutoring "
"videos, organized more than 80 times interactive discussions, produced "
"more than fifty-thousand Q&A, and drew down more than ninety-thousand "
"original words in the process of lecture preparation. In addition, we "
"investigated other high-school students&apos; awareness towards the issue"
" of education, the result was disturbing: most of them submit to the "
"current education situation and even take it for granted, while only care"
" about their own benefits and future success. To tackle down this "
"dilemma, our team strives to spread the awareness by updating public "
"account, advertising our video, open education-related electives at "
"school. Hopefully other teenagers will join us and we can lay the "
"foundation for future \"reformers\".\n"
"In addition, more and more novel ideas like partnering up with the "
"organization of Public Speaking in Beijing High Schools and cooperating "
"with the speech club of High School Affiliated to Renmin University of "
"China are assimilated and under progression."
